Oscar Wong's Personal Site

This repository is my personal site. If for whatever bizarre reason you'd like to contribute:

* Make a new branch for your changes
* Edit any of the existing files
* Make a PR to master

But you really probably should contribute to something that's *not* my personal site, so do that instead.

If you're here and you'd like to consider hiring me, I am always open to contact.
